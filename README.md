# DeFi Halal Frontend Registry 

- [DeFi Halal Frontends List](LIST.md)

## What are DeFi Halal frontends? 
We are making the system more decentralized and censorship-resistant by leaning on ecosystem to bootstrap access to the protocol.

To open loans, make deposits etc., users thus have to use one of the frontends provided by third parties. By connecting users to the protocol, frontends can earn token rewards distributed by the protocol.

## What is the Frontend Registry? 
This Frontend Registry is a place for Frontend Operators to make their existence known in order to get added to the [DeFiHalal.org Frontend Registry](https://defihalal.org/frontend). 

**Note:** This registry is *seperate* from registering your frontend with the protocol, which is a completely permissionless process. This registry only relates to this Github repository and [DeFiHalal.org](https://www.DeFiHalal.org). 

## How do I get my frontend added to the registry? 
To add your frontend to the registry, please refer to the following [guidelines and PR template](REGISTRY-GUIDELINES.md). Any PRs that deviate from the template *will not be added*. Also, please consider the uniqueness of your frontend relative to its peers. Many people will spin up Launch Kits, but consider why users may choose your frontend over another. 

*Note: Getting added to the registry is not an automated process, therefore there is no guaranteed timeline for getting your PR accepted. Please be patient.* 

## My frontend is added to the Github repository, but not the website? 
Moving frontends from the Github repository to the website is also a manual process, they will be added as soon as they can. 

## How do I report a malicious frontend? 
If you have reason to believe a frontend is a risk to users, please follow the [reporting guidelines here](REPORT-FRONTEND.md). 

## Disclaimers 
*We have not entered into any form of cooperation with Frontend Operators.*

*The list of Frontend Operators is provided for informational purposes only. Neither is the list conclusive, nor have we conducted any due diligence on these operators.* *Accordingly, DeFi Halal does not make any statement regarding technical functionality and/or the trustworthiness of the Frontend Operators listed.*
